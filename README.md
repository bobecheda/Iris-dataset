# 🌸 Iris Dataset Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook where I performed data analysis and visualization on the famous Iris dataset using **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.

---

## 📚 Objective

To practice basic data analysis, visualization, and exception handling in Python using the Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.

---

## ✅ Tools Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (for loading the dataset)

---

## 🧪 Tasks Completed

### **Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset**
- Loaded the Iris dataset using `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`
- Converted it to a `pandas.DataFrame`
- Displayed basic information: `.head()`, `.dtypes`, `.isnull()`
- Cleaned data using `.dropna()` if any missing values were found
- Included exception handling for loading and cleaning operations

### **Task 2: Basic Data Analysis**
- Computed summary statistics with `.describe()`
- Grouped by `species` and calculated mean values
- Highlighted patterns in petal/sepal measurements across species

### **Task 3: Data Visualization**
- 📊 **Bar Chart**: Average petal length per species
- 📈 **Line Plot**: Simulated trend of sepal width across samples
- 📉 **Histogram**: Distribution of sepal length
- 🟢 **Scatter Plot**: Sepal length vs petal length, colored by species

All charts were properly labeled and styled using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
